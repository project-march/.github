## Contributing steps

1. Create a new branch from the latest `develop`, if it exists in the
   repository, otherwise create a branch from `master` (or [fork], if you are
   not a member of the org). The branch name should start with `feature/` or
   `fix/`, if you are implementing a new feature or fixing something
   respectively. The branch name should end with a Jira issue key (if you have
   one) and a short description of the issue separated by `-`. Some examples
   include: `feature/PM-79-add-coverage-report` and
   `fix/PM-341-mock-as-dependencies`.
2. Implement your new feature or fix.
3. Add tests for your new feature or fix when possible. See
   https://docs.projectmarch.nl/doc/development/testing.html for more info on
   testing.
4. Make sure your code style adheres to the guidelines. See
   https://docs.projectmarch.nl/doc/development/style_guide.html for checking
   your code style.
5. Push your changes.
6. Create a pull request against the branch you branched from.
7. Fill in the pull request template to describe your changes.
8. Wait for review ðŸŽ‰
